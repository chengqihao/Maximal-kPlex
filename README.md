# kPlexList
The code of paper “Efficient Enumeration of Large Maximal k-Plexes”

## Algorithm
The sequential algorithm is in the file "Plex_seq".

The parallel version is in the file "Plex_par".

## Datasets
We provide some small datasets in the file "datasets". 

The `.txt` files are the original datasets, while files with suffix of `.bin` are preprocessed files we use. 

All the datasets can be found on SNAP and LAW
## Experiment
### Tested Environment
* RedHatEnterpriseServer 7.9
* C++ 14
* g++ - 7.2.0
